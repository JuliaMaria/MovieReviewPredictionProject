# Data preprocessing
The following features from the dataset were used: 'cast', 'director', 'budget', 'genres', 'production_companies', 'runtime', 'release_year', 'vote_average'. For each movie for feature 'cast' only 5 leading actors were taken into account. Features 'cast', 'director', 'genres' and 'production_companies' were preprocessed with one-hot encoder using only 500 most frequent values for 'cast', 'director' and 'production_companies'.
